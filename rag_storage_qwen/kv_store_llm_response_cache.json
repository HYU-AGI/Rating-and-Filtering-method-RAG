Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.
